/**
 * Burn a recording's redaction boxes into the video, permanently.
 *
 * A box drawn over a playing video hides nothing: the stored file still has
 * the pixels, and they can be read from the network tab, a download, the
 * poster image or the editor's filmstrip. This action is what makes a
 * redaction mean what people assume it means — the covered pixels are
 * destroyed, the new file replaces the old one, and the old one is deleted.
 *
 * Four things this gets right, each of which is a way it could go wrong:
 *
 *  - **Only the redaction is burned, never the cuts.** Comments, reactions,
 *    chapters and transcript segments are stored against the original clock.
 *    The re-encode keeps the recording's full length, so every one of them
 *    still lands where it did, and the timeline stays editable afterwards.
 *  - **The derived images are rebuilt.** The thumbnail, the animated
 *    thumbnail and the editor filmstrip are separate files made from the
 *    unredacted frames — the filmstrip is literally a grid of them. Leaving
 *    any of them in place would leak exactly what was redacted.
 *  - **The row points at the new file before the old one is deleted**, so a
 *    failure never leaves a recording pointing at something that is gone.
 *  - **A failed delete fails the action, loudly.** The video is already
 *    redacted at that point, but the original is still sitting in storage and
 *    the owner has to know.
 *
 * There is no undo. What was under the box is gone from the file.
 *
 * UI-only: destructive and irreversible, so it is not offered as an agent
 * tool. The agent can place redactions with `set-recording-overlays`; a person
 * decides when they are burned.
