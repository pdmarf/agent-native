/**
 * Redactions on a video: a rectangle that covers part of the picture for a
 * stretch of time, and can move while it is there.
 *
 * Three things drive the design.
 *
 * **A redaction is not real until it is burned in.** A box drawn over a
 * playing video is decoration — the stored file still has the pixels, and
 * anyone can read them from the network tab, a download, the poster image or
 * the editor's filmstrip. So these live in `editsJson.overlays` while they are
 * being placed, and `burn-recording-redactions` renders them into a new file
 * and deletes the old one. Until that runs, nothing is hidden from anybody.
 *
 * **Solid fill, not blur.** A Gaussian blur is a reversible convolution, and a
 * mosaic of a short guessable string can be attacked by rendering candidates
 * and comparing blocks. `app/lib/screenshot-redaction.ts` has the long version
 * of this argument; the conclusion is the same here, and a video gives an
 * attacker many frames of the same region to work with, which only helps them.
 *
 * **It can move, but it cannot follow.** Nothing here tracks content. A
 * redaction carries a list of positions in time and slides between them, so a
 * box can follow a scroll the user has traced by hand. One position means it
 * stays put. On a fast movement the interpolation can lag the content by a
 * frame or two, which is why the editor says to draw the box larger than the
 * thing it covers.
 *
 * Coordinates are normalized 0–1 against the video's own dimensions, like
 * `blurs`, so they survive any display size and any re-encode.

/**
 * Build the graph that burns these redactions in.
 *
 * Each stretch crops the box out of a copy of the picture, destroys what is
 * inside that small piece — averaged into blocks, or filled flat — and lays it
 * back over the frame. The crop and the overlay both follow the box: `crop`
 * re-evaluates x and y every frame and `overlay` does too, so a movement of
 * any length costs one pair of filters however long it lasts.
 *
 * **Work only on the piece, never the whole frame.** Measured on a
 * sixteen-second 1920x1042 clip, against 130s for the encode alone:
 * pixelizing the whole frame and cropping that cost +34s, and painting the
 * whole frame flat to crop a black patch out of it cost **+230s**. Cropping
 * first costs +8s. The area covered is a few percent of the picture; the
 * filters should see a few percent of the pixels.
 *
 * `drawbox` is not used to draw the box itself, for a different reason: it
 * evaluates its geometry once, at filter init, so it cannot move. Here it only
 * ever fills a crop that has already been positioned.
 *
 * The source is split explicitly rather than referenced more than once, which
 * ffmpeg rejects. Every value is a number this module formatted, never text
 * from the user, so nothing in the graph can be read as filter syntax;
 * expressions are single-quoted, which is how ffmpeg's parser is told that the
 * commas inside them belong to the expression.
